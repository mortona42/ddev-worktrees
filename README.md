# ddev-worktree

A global DDEV add-on that clones an existing DDEV project (files + database) into a new directory. If the project is a git repo, it uses `git worktree` to create a linked worktree; otherwise it copies files with rsync.

The new directory gets its own DDEV project name via `config.worktree.local.yaml`, so both instances can run simultaneously without collision.

## Installation

```bash
ddev add-on install elabx/ddev-worktrees
```

Or install from a local clone:

```bash
ddev add-on install /path/to/ddev-worktree
```

Once installed, the `ddev worktree` and `ddev worktree-remove` commands are available in every DDEV project.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd ~/projects/my-site

# Create a worktree for a new branch
ddev worktree feature-login

# Both projects now run side-by-side
ddev list
# my-site          running
# my-site-feature-login  running

# Done with the worktree? Clean up
ddev worktree-remove feature-login
```

## Usage

### `ddev worktree`

```
ddev worktree <branch-or-name> [--profile=NAME] [--no-db] [--no-start] [--force]
```

Creates a clone of the current DDEV project in a sibling directory.

**What it does:**

1. Exports the database from the source project
2. Creates the target directory via `git worktree add` (or `rsync` if not a git repo)
3. Copies `.ddev/` if it's gitignored
4. Copies any files specified in the profile's `copy` list
5. Creates `.ddev/config.worktree.local.yaml` with a unique project name
6. Starts DDEV and imports the database
7. Runs any `post_create` commands from the profile

**Flags:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--profile=NAME` | Which profile from `.ddev/worktree-hooks.yaml` to use |
| `--no-db` | Skip database export/import |
| `--no-start` | Create files only — don't start DDEV or run post_create |
| `--force`, `-f` | Overwrite an existing target directory/project |

**Target directory:** `../<source-dirname>-<sanitized-name>`
**Target project name:** `<source-project>-<sanitized-name>`

Branch names are sanitized for use as directory names (e.g., `feature/foo` becomes `feature-foo`).

### `ddev worktree-remove`

```
ddev worktree-remove <name> [--list]
```

**List clones:**

```bash
ddev worktree-remove --list
```

**Remove a clone:**

```bash
ddev worktree-remove feature-login
```

This stops the DDEV project, removes the git worktree (or deletes the directory), and cleans up. It refuses to remove directories that don't have a `config.worktree.local.yaml` as a safety measure (the older `config.worktree.yaml` is still accepted, so worktrees created before v1.1.0 remain removable).

## Configuration: `.ddev/worktree-hooks.yaml`

Create this file in your project's `.ddev/` directory to configure what gets copied and what commands run after clone creation. Commit it to git so your team shares the same setup.

```yaml
# .ddev/worktree-hooks.yaml
default_profile: full

profiles:
  full:
    copy:
      - site/assets
      - .env
    post_create:
      - composer install
      - npm install

  minimal:
    copy:
      - .env
    post_create:
      - composer install

  frontend:
    copy:
      - .env
    post_create:
      - npm install
```

**Fields:**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `default_profile` | Which profile to use when `--profile` is not specified |
| `profiles.<name>.copy` | Files/directories to copy from source to target (relative to project root). Use this for things not in git: uploads, `.env`, etc. |
| `profiles.<name>.post_create` | Shell commands to run in the target directory after DDEV is started |

If no `.ddev/worktree-hooks.yaml` exists, the command works fine — it just skips the copy and post_create steps.

### Profile Examples

> **Note:** Only the ProcessWire profile has been tested. The other profiles are untested examples — adapt them to your project's needs.

**ProcessWire:**

```yaml
default_profile: full

profiles:
  full:
    copy:
      - site/assets
      - .env
    post_create:
      - composer install

  minimal:
    copy:
      - .env
    post_create:
      - composer install

  frontend:
    copy:
      - .env
      - site/assets
    post_create:
      - npm install
```

**Drupal:**

```yaml
default_profile: full

profiles:
  full:
    copy:
      - sites/default/files
      - .env
    post_create:
      - composer install
      - ddev drush cr
```

**Laravel:**

```yaml
default_profile: full

profiles:
  full:
    copy:
      - storage/app
      - .env
    post_create:
      - composer install
      - npm install
      - ddev artisan key:generate
```

**WordPress:**

```yaml
default_profile: full

profiles:
  full:
    copy:
      - wp-content/uploads
      - .env
    post_create:
      - composer install
```

## How It Works

### Project Isolation

The clone gets a `config.worktree.local.yaml` with `override_config: true` and a unique `name` field. This overrides the project name from `config.yaml` without modifying any git-tracked files. Both projects can run simultaneously with their own containers, databases, and URLs.

### Git Worktree Behavior

When the source project is a git repo:

- **Existing local branch** — `git worktree add <path> <branch>`
- **Remote branch only** — creates a local tracking branch
- **No such branch** — creates a new branch from HEAD

### Non-Git Projects

If there's no git repo, the command uses `rsync` to copy all files, excluding DDEV runtime artifacts.

### Keeping git clean

The generated config is named `config.worktree.local.yaml`, and the `.local.` is deliberate: DDEV's own generated `.ddev/.gitignore` already ignores `/config.*.local.y*ml`. The file stays out of `git status` without this add-on writing to `.gitignore`, `.git/info/exclude`, or any other git-owned file.

One wrinkle: `.ddev/.gitignore` is itself untracked, so a fresh worktree starts without it and the config is briefly visible to `git status`. The first `ddev start` regenerates the ignore file and it disappears. With `--no-start`, it stays visible until you start the project.

### Database transfer

With a database export (the default), the dump is written to a private temp directory created with `mktemp -d` under `$TMPDIR` (falling back to `/tmp`), and removed by an `EXIT`/`INT`/`TERM` trap — so an interrupted or failed run leaves nothing behind, and concurrent runs never collide.

## Troubleshooting

### Updates leave an older command installed

Older releases omitted the `#ddev-generated` marker from the global commands.
DDEV treats those files as user-managed and reports `NOT overwriting` during
installation, so an upgrade can leave the old behavior in place.

Back up any local command changes, then add `#ddev-generated` on its own line
below the shebang in both `~/.ddev/commands/host/worktree` and
`~/.ddev/commands/host/worktree-remove`. Reinstall the add-on from a DDEV project
directory. The commands now ship with this marker so subsequent upgrades can
replace them normally.

### Many untracked files under `.ddev/` in an older worktree

Older commands created `.ddev/.gitignore` containing only `config.worktree.yaml`.
That prevents DDEV from generating its normal ignore rules. If the file contains
only that entry, replace it with `#ddev-generated` and run `ddev start`. Preserve
any custom rules if you have edited the file yourself.

For an older `config.worktree.yaml`, rename it to `config.worktree.local.yaml`
before starting DDEV. The current command uses this name, which DDEV ignores
automatically. Keep only one of these config files.

### `mktemp: mkstemp failed on /tmp/ddev-worktree-db-XXXXXX.sql.gz: File exists`

Affects **v1.1.0 and earlier on macOS**. Those versions built the dump path with the `X` placeholders mid-string (`ddev-worktree-db-XXXXXX.sql.gz`). BSD `mktemp` only substitutes a *trailing* run of `X`s, so the name was used literally — the same fixed path on every run. There was also no cleanup trap, so any failure between export and import left the file behind, and every later run then failed on it.

Unblock an affected machine:

```bash
rm -f /tmp/ddev-worktree-db-*.sql.gz
```

Then upgrade to v1.1.1 or later, which uses a temp directory plus a cleanup trap. Note that reinstalling or updating the add-on overwrites `~/.ddev/commands/host/worktree`, so patch the repo rather than the installed copy.

## Dependencies

- **DDEV >= v1.24.0**
- **yq** (recommended) — for full YAML parsing of `.ddev/worktree-hooks.yaml`. Install via `brew install yq` or see [yq docs](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq). Without yq, the command falls back to basic grep/awk parsing with a warning.
- **rsync** — for file copying (pre-installed on macOS and most Linux distributions)

## Uninstall

```bash
ddev add-on remove ddev-worktree
```
